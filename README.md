# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure.
My name is Katpolice and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like Scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of Python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses. So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode and Lynda.
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk. 

So, I started a coding journal.

July/3/19 - 
I started working on the Community starter kit which is offered by The GitHub Training Team. I completed the first course step "Add a repository description". However, it seems like I messed up with the "EDit the README" section and I'm trying to troubleshoot it. By the looks of it, it seems like I accidently messed up one of the steps and which off track. Resulting in a unfixable loop that I can't seem to fix and/or undo. Therefore it seems like I have to restart the whole Community starter kit. Currently on Lynda, I'm watching a playlist called "Programming Foundations: Fundamentals" inorder to get a strong foundation in programming. So far I learned about "machine languages" and appearly C+ is closer to it then somelike like Python. 
In other news, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram are having troubles with sending photos to other users on there platform. All 3 companies are owned by Facebook. Likewise, Twitter is having troubles with there private message system. I suspect a DDoS by some company or organization because it's literally the day before July 4th. Or it could be some shady plot to extract specific images and/or private messages from certain individuals/groups. Honestly, who knows at this point until there's a formal news conference. 
Random fact of the day: Warren Buffet filed his first tax return at age 13 to report income from his paper route, and claimed a $35 deduction for use of his bicycle. Source: https://www.factslides.com/i-9484 
That's all for today, Katpolice (Gilbert) signing off.
