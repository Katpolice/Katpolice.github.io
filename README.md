# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure. It contains a journal of my progress. 
My name is Katpolice (Gilbert) and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like Scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of Python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses. So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode, Khan Academy and Lynda.
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.

A work in progress.
