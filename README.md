# hello-world
The beginning of a coding adventure.
My name is Katpolice and I'm offically starting my grind on becoming a developer today. 
I do have some past experience with programming like scratch, Ev3 basic, RobotC and a bit of python.
However, beyond that exposure and trial and error from years of experience with Robotics, I havn't formally taken any programming classes/courses.
So as of today (July/2/19) I will begin my formal coding jounery with websites like Github, EdX, LeetCode and Lynda. 
Thank you for listening to my Ted talk.
